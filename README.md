# CXQ-ML

-------
A comparison of Classical and Quantum Machine Learning Approach for Neural Networks in <b>binary image classification</b>.

## Objective

-------
How performant is one over the other? We will try to answer this by designing two types of neural networks for each approach (Classical and Quantum). 
 - From scratch
  - training neural network with no prior knowledge
 - Using Transfer Learning
  - using knowledge with networks trained in Imagenet classification


### Datasets

-------
The datasets that will be used are:
 - MNIST (60k Images)
  - http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
 - Bees and Ants taken from Imagenet (240 Images)
  - https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/hymenoptera data.zip
 - COVID-19 X-Ray (317 Images)
  - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset
 - Blood Cells for Malaria prediction (27.5k Images)
